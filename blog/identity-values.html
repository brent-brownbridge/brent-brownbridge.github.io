Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
In my previous work place a patient came in but could not afford care. We were very busy and understaffed. I made an ethical decision to put aside current work and contact gov funding 
criteria offcials directly. This was not considered part of the job but a bit above and beyond because I felt obliged to help this patient. The decision to do this do not go down well
with my managers but I felt I had done the right thing at the end of the day. Although it may be difficult and others may discourrage you, making and ethically correct decision will always be the 
right thing to do.

Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
My twin brother is currently a developer and has been for approximately 7 years. I have watched what he does and often discussed a lot about what he does and the learning involved. This has led me to take interest in what he does and drove me to learn for myself.

Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
I am motivated and interested in the current study which helps a lot with productivity and the drive to continue learning. I like to think I am relatively self-aware. This helps me to know when I can knuckle down and absorb information or if I need a break for a moment. Knowing your limits and your own mind and body can help with all sorts of learning.

Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
I often have poor time management. This affects me to complete certain tasks in a timely manner. This may affect current and future workflow. It is a skill I must work on.

Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
There was a university workgroup in which we had to complete an extensive year-long project. From the very beginning my 3 other group members did not get along. This led to poor attendance and collaboration in the beginning.  At first we tried to have an internal meeting/discussion to sort the group members' differences, but this failed. Secondly we then contacted one of our preceptors, and eventually both preceptors. In hindsight I think attempting to handle the situation internally was a good idea, but would have been much better to initially include a preceptor or even a third party that was not involved to get a fair outside perspective and improve the situation faster.
