<h1>Foundations Reflections</h1>
<h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
<p>At first I thought I was quite sure what made a good programmer and my ego may have lead me to stronger believe this. But after completing foundations I realised I was wrong. At first I thought it was more a logical and mathematical thinker but come to realise general problem solving skills, a growing mindset and even emotional intelligence are both vital in becoming a strong or “good” programmer especially in the learning phases.</p>
<h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
<p>Knowing your own values and being aware of what you are doing and feeling, help shape your learning patterns and know your strengths and weaknesses. Understanding these will help you master your learning capabilities. Empathy enables people to identify problems others may be facing and, from there, develop solutions. Becoming a better suiting person in any workplace.</p>
<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
<p>The more I applied some of the core learnings such as thinking with a growth mindset, the more I believed in it and became more self aware of my mind set.</p>
<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
<p>Creating a learning plan was the more difficult challenge for me. This was mainly due to motivation and my mindset on such learnings. But after focusing on my mindset and applying neuroplasticity I found it less challenging. </p>
<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
<p>As core learnings are essential not only to coding but to almost every aspect and situation in life. Using these core skills can help with productivity and mindset to overall be better in your chosen career/profession.</p>
<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
<p>Admittedly at times during core learning exercises it felt like a waste of time. Personally completing larger writing tasks I tend to find a bore. But I found it wasn’t until days after that the core learnings began to sink in, and I came to realise the importance of these core skills.  As over time, especially in times when I was stuck with my code, I found myself resorting to my general techniques to recover. As I leant towards these techniques more often I found a resemblance between these and what we had learnt in core skills. I would usually try a technique such as taking a break and trying to better my mood and be more positive - then I realised this really the use of a growth mindset and neuroplasticity. </p>
