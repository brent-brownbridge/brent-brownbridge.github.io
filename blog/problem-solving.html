<h1>Problem Solving</h1>
<h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
<h3>were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
<p>A simple problem I tend to come across is having mis-spelt or incorrectly capitalising a letter. The first place to turn is the VS build in helper which often picks these up (as I came to realise) and then to go through line by line and ready back to yourself what each line of code is trying to achieve and check this is passing. It is frustrating, even when I do find the error and fix it, something so simple can cause what seems like a disaster in coding. 
</p>
<h3>elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
<p>The Kata problems. Once completing a block of these with ease (with some of them - not all!) it truly felt good as if the hard word was paying off. I tend to go back to the basics and work up and this technique tends to yield my best results. I learnt starting with the basics can help prompt ideas when you are stuck.

<h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
<p>I feel confident in most of these processes except feel I need work on, asking for help and improving my reflection’s. More so asking help from my pairs and getting involved in bouncing ideas off other students. I believe once bootcamp starts interactions should increase naturally. Also reflecting seems to be a real “chore” for me and I need to change my perspective around reflecting.</p>
<h3>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h3>
<p>This was usually due to fear out of sounding stupid, or sounding as if I am falling behind work. But as the programme progressed and talking with the facilitators I was aidedd in asking for help. The dev team made me feel comfortable asking for help when needed and generally improving my ability to identify when and where I need to ask for help. Looking back I do not have the fair I intially had of asking for help, and I believe foundations core work has helped with this.</p>
