      <h1> JavaScript & the DOM</h1>
        <h3>Javascript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
          Firstly HTML and CSS are your main components to build and display a webpage. Javascript is a coding language that allows you to add a dynamic display and or a behaviour to a element on the page (which HTML and CSS can not achieve alone). This allows you to have a much more interactive and interesting page by adding/displaying such things as control multimedia, animate images and almost anything else!</p>
          <h3> What is control flow?</h3>
          <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.</p>
          <h3> What are loops?</h3>
          <p>Loops are used in Javascript when needed to execute repeated tasks depending on a certain condition (true/false, </>, class). In a JS loop you can set parameters for where the loop will start, where to finish, and what to do each time it passes through the loop/completes a loop.  
          </p>
          <p> A real life example might be if your a particularly fussy person and like to brush your hair the exact same way each day. Each morning you would repeat the process of brushing your hair (e.g left to right, top to bottom, curl, curl, repeat x3) repeating the same process you had previously planned - this is your loop. Your flow control would be to continue each step of brushing your hair in the same order every time.
          </p>
          <h3> What is the DOM </h3>
          <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model - this is a interface that allows developers to interact with the HTML document by treating the document as a “tree-like” structure and allowing the change of style, structure and content via this tree-like structure.</p>
          <h3> Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
          <p>When accessing an array we must specify which index position in which the data we want to extract/use by using [x]</p>
          <p>When accessing an object we may either use the "dot property" or the "square bracket property". The dot property should have the syntax object.property-you-want. Where as the square bracket property instead of using .property you use object[property] to access the data you want.</p>
          <h3> What are functions and why are they helpful?</h3>
          <p>A function in JS is similar to a procedure — a set of statements that performs a task or calculation. But for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output. Functions allow you to reuse procedures and also allow more organise and structured code - especially when using large code bases. </p>
