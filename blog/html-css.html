<h1>What is the difference between magin, border, and padding?</h1>
<p>When you are displaying content on a website CSS uses what is called a “box model” to display different elements on the page. Take an element/content such as an image or text box it will have a border around it which may be or may not be visible. The distance between you content and your boarder is called the padding. The margin can be thought of as the free space between the boarder and the box. Using these parameters (boarder, padding, margin) you can adjust the display of your content on the webpage. Padding may be used to change the size/visibility of the content within a box. Margins control the “invisible barrier” around a box and can be used to define how content interacts with other content and the side of the page.</p>
