What is your long term goal or career pathway?
My long term goal is to learn as much coding across the most common languages before applying for a career as a developer. Because I am also experienced in the health sector I would possible seek a developers career linked to health care or health care applications.  

A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
My stregths in learning include: being self aware and I am able to understand content at a relatively decent pace. I often am poor at time management and working in a timely manner. 

What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
Become more confident when asking for help.

A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: 
Treating the course content like a 9-5 job and put in the time within these hours (possible more towards the end of the course) to allow better time management. 

An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.
Be friendly and approchable to all team members and do my best to stay on task and aid others in their work.

What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
Time time to step back and refresh. Use stress release techniques and plan accordingly to allow for time away from study and to enjoy hobbies.

A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
Firstly I would try to seek for help myself online.  Secondly I would ask in the foundations discord channel. Thirdly I would ask the workgroup for help and finally I would turn to the facilitator to ask for help.

A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
To be contactable when students are in need of help or have course related questions. Of course this has all been great so far.

Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
