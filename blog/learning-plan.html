  <h1> My Learning Plan </h1>
  <p class="qcolor"> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
<p>My long term goal is to learn as much coding across the most common languages before applying for a career as a developer. Because I am also experienced in the health sector I would possible seek a developers career linked to health care or health care applications.</p>  
<p class="qcolor">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</p>
<p>My stregths in learning include: being self aware and I am able to understand content at a relatively decent pace. I often am poor at time management and working in a timely manner.</p> 

<p class="qcolor">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
<p>Become more confident when asking for help.</p>

<p class="qcolor">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</p> 
<p>Treating the course content like a 9-5 job and put in the time within these hours (possible more towards the end of the course) to allow better time management.</p>

<p class="qcolor">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p>
<p>Be friendly and approchable to all team members and do my best to stay on task and aid others in their work.</p>

<p class="qcolor">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</p>
<p>Time time to step back and refresh. Use stress release techniques and plan accordingly to allow for time away from study and to enjoy hobbies.</p>

<p class="qcolor">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
<p>Firstly I would try to seek for help myself online.  Secondly I would ask in the foundations discord channel. Thirdly I would ask the workgroup for help and finally I would turn to the facilitator to ask for help.</p>

<p class="qcolor">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
<p>To be contactable when students are in need of help or have course related questions. Of course this has all been great so far.</p>
