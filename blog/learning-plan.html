  <h1> My Learning Plan </h1>
<h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
<p>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind? </p>
<h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
<p>I am rather limited by my time management as mentioned earlier and I think this would also continue to be my biggest downfall in bootcamp but aim to improve on this skill. Being self aware will help me understand my own learning style and aid me down my learning path.</p>
<h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
<p>Getting to Newmarket on time. This will require better time management and planning.</p>
<h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>I would like to work on my time management but this will mainly come down to personal growth. At bootcamp I would like to improve my reflective abilities and become at ease with reflecting upon myself.</p>
<h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>  
<p>To be available and friendly when a student is in need of help (which they already are) and to understand students frustrations when stuck.</p>
<h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
<p>To be committed full time with bootcamp and to not undertake too many other task, to avoid becoming overburdened. I would like to push myself to put in as much effort not to just complete tasks but to understand the core learning and be able to effectively apply the learnt abilities in other scenarios (coding or not).</p>
<h3> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
<p>My long term goal is to learn as much coding across the most common languages before applying for a career as a developer. Because I am also experienced in the health sector I would possible seek a developers career linked to health care or health care applications.</p>  
<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h3>
<p>My stregths in learning include: being self aware and I am able to understand content at a relatively decent pace. I often am poor at time management and working in a timely manner.</p> 

<h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>Become more confident when asking for help.</p>

<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3> 
<p>Treating the course content like a 9-5 job and put in the time within these hours (possible more towards the end of the course) to allow better time management.</p>

<h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
<p>Be friendly and approchable to all team members and do my best to stay on task and aid others in their work.</p>

<h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
<p>Time time to step back and refresh. Use stress release techniques and plan accordingly to allow for time away from study and to enjoy hobbies.</p>

<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
<p>Firstly I would try to seek for help myself online.  Secondly I would ask in the foundations discord channel. Thirdly I would ask the workgroup for help and finally I would turn to the facilitator to ask for help.</p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
<p>To be contactable when students are in need of help or have course related questions. Of course this has all been great so far.</p>
